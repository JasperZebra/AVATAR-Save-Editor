# Avatar: The Game  - Save Editor (WIP)

A Python-based save editor for **Avatar: The Game** for the **Xbox 360** and **PC** versions of the game, featuring a graphical user interface for modifying game saves.

## Here's an example of what you can do with this save editor and what was changed:
  - Changed the player pawn to the Na'vi body in the tutorial area **(Can't do this normally)**
  - Changed the Head, Chest, and Leg armor pieces to differnet sets **(Armor pieces can't be chnged normally)**
